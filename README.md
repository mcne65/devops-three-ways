# DevOps Three Ways

### What this is

This is a workshop for deploying the same application three ways: Using EC2, Using Docker (with both ECS and Kubernetes), and finally with Serverless. With this workshop, you will be able to:

 - *Understand* continuous delivery and why it's important.
 - *Explain* the differences between different ways of deploying software.
 - *Evaluate* the right deployment solutions for different problems.

Note that this workshop does not cover continuous improvement (CI) and build pipelines.

This workshop contains four separate practical exercises:

1.) Creating an EC2 Instance and building things *manually*

2.) Creating the same thing with *Cloudformation*

3.) Creating the same thing with *Docker*

4.) Creating the same thing with *S3 Buckets*
